# Nuron - NFT Marketplace: Main Phase Project - Make it Real TOP Program v30

This project was developed using React.js for the frontend and Sass as a preprocessor for CSS. We used Node.js and Express for the backend, and Prisma ORM for managing our relational database. Finally, the frontend is deployed on Vercel and the backend is deployed on Render.

## Characteristics of the project:
- An online marketplace to create and trade NFTs.
- Allows the user to create, sell and buy NFTS from other users through auctions.
- Allows the administrator to gain commission for every NFT sold, also to create and delete users.
- The users can create their account and sign in using Google.

## Start running üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to obtain a copy of the running project in your local machine, for the purpose of development and testing.

### Prerequisites üìã

The things you will need to install the software are a computer that isn't too old, a text editor to help you read all the code with pretty colors, and the will to deal with code written by a group of 3 people learning how to program!

### Installation üîß

1. Clone the repositories to your local machine: 
```
git clone git@github.com:TatianaIng96/nft-marketplace-frontend.git
```

and

```
git clone git@github.com:TatianaIng96/nft-marketplace-backend.git
```

2. Change directory to /nft-marketplace-frontend:
```
cd nft-marketplace-frontend
```

Also change to /nft-marketplace-backend in the second repository:
```
cd nft-marketplace-backend
```

3. Install the frontend and backend dependencies:

Make sure to have installed Node.js:
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Then, run npm install on each of the repositories:
```
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file to include the backend URL.

5. Run the code!

Make sure to be in each repository:
```
cd nft-marketplace-frontend
```
Once there, execute
```
npm run dev
```
For the backend, execute the same commands. Remember to keep both running!

6. Access the application from your browser
